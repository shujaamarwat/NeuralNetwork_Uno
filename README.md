#Experimental Codes for Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Sequential Model training of a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. 

Libraries that are being used are Tensorflow, Keras, numpy and pyplot.

This repository contains code samples for Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

The code is written for Python. 

As the code is an experiment. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel free to fork and modify the code.
